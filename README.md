# CSS Framework Discussion

NOTE: This repo is meant to be used by members of my coding meetup. In the future it may open up to other people.

## Description

This repo is meant to be used to discuss my idea for a simple CSS framework. For now we will use the GitHub Discussions feature, but we might try a different method if it doesn't work that well.

The goal is to create a mostly classless CSS framework, with a handful of classes for some basic components. The end result should be something similar to [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/). I also really like the classless frameworks listed in this awesome list: https://github.com/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks

One big difference between my idea and other frameworks is I want to clearly document how developers can customize the elements and components. For example, instead of being limited to just one type of button, I want to show how users can add their own CSS to change the shape of the button.

## Goals
- Develop framework using plain CSS instead of SCSS
- Follow best practices for CSS and HTML
- Accessibility
- Flexibility/customization
- Small learning curve
